## Overview

A lightweight, user-friendly utility that adds customizable hot corners to your computer. Among other things, Charmy features a modern design, allows per-monitor configuration, and supports delayed triggers - that is, triggering a hot corner only if the cursor has sat there for the specified duration. All free of cost.

## Available Actions

- Do nothing (default, "None" in the app)
- Open Task view
- Open Start
- Open Search
- Go to desktop

### New in v1.1

- Previous virtual desktop ("Previous desktop" in the app)
- Next virtual desktop ("Next desktop" in the app)

## License

Charmy is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) licensed under the GPLv3 - you may take a look at the license [here](https://github.com/YourOrdinaryCat/Charmy/blob/9b363da5f930142223c5e6ff807a38803624acb4/LICENSE.txt).

## Privacy

Charmy (listed in the Microsoft Store as "Charmy: Hot Corners for Windows") won't collect any personal data on its own. It may generate log files, which shouldn't contain personal data - even if those somehow did (for example, through external manipulation), you (the user) have full control over them, and may share or delete them at your discretion. Charmy won't upload those files anywhere on its own.

You may disable those log files by opening the app, going to "About > Log verbosity", and picking "Off". This will not delete previously generated logs - you may visit the folder storing them by opening the app, clicking on "About", and clicking the "Open logs folder" button.

Additionally, if Charmy crashes, and was installed from the Microsoft Store, the developer ({{ site.author }}) might get anonymized information that may include:

- Stack trace
- System specs
- Process list at the time of the crash
- A memory dump of the app's two processes

The developer will only use the information if necessary for the debugging process of Charmy. Additionally, this data will be deleted when no longer necessary.
